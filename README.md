# Module 8 Integration — Retrieval-Augmented Service

Build a complete retrieval-augmented mini-service: retrieve top-k context from
Weaviate, construct a context-injected prompt, call `flan-t5-base`, return the
answer with the retrieved context, and evaluate end-to-end on a 30-question set.

Full assignment instructions are on the **Integration Task page** in
TalentLMS → Module 8 → Integration Task.

> **TODO (replace this README before submitting):** Rewrite this file to cover
> the five sections in Task 9 of the guide — Overview, Setup, How to run it,
> Eval output (paste your `evaluate_rag` result here including the four headline
> metric keys), and Known limitations. The autograder will not accept this
> placeholder README.

## Setup

1. Bring up Weaviate locally:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name weaviate-int \
     -p 8080:8080 \
     -e DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE=none \
     -e ENABLE_MODULES= \
     -e PERSISTENCE_DATA_PATH=/var/lib/weaviate \
     semitechnologies/weaviate:1.24.10
   ```

2. Install dependencies (cached from the lab — should be fast):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ingest the corpus once (idempotent — safe to re-run):
   ```bash
   python ingest.py
   ```

4. Implement `rag_service.py` (the 6 functions: `retrieve`, `build_prompt`,
   `generate`, `rag_pipeline`, `groundedness_score`, `evaluate_rag`).

5. Replace the `pytest.fail(...)` stubs in `tests/test_rag.py` with real
   assertions (3 required tests).

6. Run the autograder locally:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v
   ```

7. Open a PR on branch `integration-8-rag-service`.

## What to Expect from the Canonical Baseline

See the guide's framing block (top of the Integration Task page) for the
expected ranges of the four headline evaluation metrics under the canonical
methodology. The low main-keyword-recall result is **expected** and is a
property of the generator under the abstention prompt — not a bug in your
pipeline.

The Tier 1 challenge formalises this with an intervention experiment.

## PR description must include

- The full `evaluate_rag` output (all four headline metric keys).
- Two example queries with answers + groundedness scores (one high, one low).
- Paste your PR URL into TalentLMS → Module 8 → Integration Task.

## Files

- `rag_service.py` — your implementation (6 functions; `STOPWORDS` and
  `ABSTAIN_PHRASES` constants are pre-populated — do not modify).
- `index_helpers.py` — provided helpers: `index_corpus_if_needed`,
  `bm25_search`, `dense_search`, `hybrid_search` (you don't implement these).
- `ingest.py` — runnable driver (no edits needed).
- `data/corpus.jsonl` — same technical-Q&A corpus as the lab.
- `data/rag_eval.jsonl` — 30-row eval set (`single_fact` / `single_doc_synthesis`
  / `borderline` mix).
- `tests/test_rag.py` — 3 learner-written test stubs (replace `pytest.fail`).
- `tests/test_autograder.py` — 11 autograder tests.
- `LICENSE` + `ATTRIBUTION.md` — corpus license (CC BY-SA) and attribution.
